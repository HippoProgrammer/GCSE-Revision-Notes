# Geography (Y10) - River Processes
## Erosion
### Definition
Erosion is the picking up of rocks and materials.

### Location
Mostly in the upper course.

### Direction
**Vertical Erosion** - erosion down, increases river depth

**Lateral Erosion** - erosion from side to side <->, increases river width

### Types
There are 4 main types:

**Hydraulic Action** - The force of the river causes air and water to be trapped in cracks in rocks and leads to them breaking up.

**Abrasion** - Rocks carried along by the river wear down the bed and banks (like sandpaper).

**Attrition** - Rocks carried along by the river smash against one another, so they wear down into smaller and more rounded particles.

**Solution** - Minerals from rocks in the river bed are dissolved in the river water.

## Transportation
### Definition
Transportation is how the river moves its load.

### Location
In all three courses.

### Types
There are 4 main types (from top to bottom, decreasing material size and energy / flow rate required to occur):

Rolling along the river bed:
	
**Traction**: Large boulders and rocks are rolled along the river bed
	
**Saltation**: Small pebbles and stones are bounced along the river bed

Floating in the river water:

**Suspension**: Fine, light material is carried along by the river

**Solution**: Minerals are dissolved in the river water

## Deposition
### Definition
Deposition is when a river drops load as it loses energy, when it slows down or loses water.

### Location
Usually in the lower course, or where there is flat ground.

### Process
As the river slows the largest loads will be dropped first (see transportation) as the methods of transportation used to transport the largest loads require the most energy to be maintained.
