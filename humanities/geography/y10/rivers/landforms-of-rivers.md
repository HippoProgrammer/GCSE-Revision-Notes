# Geography (Y10) - River Landforms
## Landforms Resulting from Erosion
### V-shaped Valleys and Interlocking Spurs
* Formed in the upper course near the source of the river
* Formed through vertical erosion
* The winding river cuts downwards to create interlocking spurs
### Waterfalls and Gorges
* Water flows over both hard and soft rock. 
* The soft rock below gets eroded faster, forming an overhang.
* Gorges are narrow, steep-sided valleys between hills or mountains, formed by a waterfall 'moving back' (upstream) as it continually gets eroded.

## Landforms Resulting from Deposition
### Meanders and Oxbow Lakes
* Formed in the middle course
* Formed through lateral erosion and deposition
* If at any point the river gets even a slight imbalance in flow between the sides, the side with the higher flow will have material eroded at a greater rate, and the side with the lower flow will have material deposited at a greater rate.
* This accentuates the difference between the sides, causing a curve to begin forming on the side with higher flow.
* This then increases the flow rate differential between the sides, increasing the rate of the meanders forming.
* Eventually, if the neck of the meander joins together, the river will divert along the new faster path, leaving a meander-shaped oxbow lake.
### Levees and Floodplains
* Formed in the lower course
* Formed through deposition
* A floodplain is the wide, flat area around a river that is covered in times of flood, usually very fertile due to the rich material deposited by floodwaters.
* Levees are formed by rivers that flow slowly, carry a large load and periodically flood. When flooding occurs, water flows over the sides of the channel, onto the floodplain. As coarser materials are deposited first, they build up in ridges over time - levees. These act as a natural flood defense by increasing the river capacity.
