# Geography (Y10) - Features of Rivers
## Definitions
* Drainage Basin - The area drained by one river and its tributaries
* Watershed - A line separating two drainage basins
* Tributary - A smaller river that joins a larger river
* Confluence - Where two rivers join
* Source - Where a river begins
* Mouth - Where a river flows into the sea or a lake
* Discharge - The amount of water flowing through a river, measured in cumecs (m^3/s)
* Width - How wide the river channel is
* Depth - How deep the river channel is
* Velocity - Speed of flow
* Thalweg - Fastest current
* Load - Amount of material carried by a river

### Courses
**Upper Course**:
* From the source to the Middle Course
* Depth: Shallow
* Width: Narrow, V-shaped valley
* Processes: Erosion, Transportation
* Features: Waterfalls, Rapids

**Middle Course**:
* From the Upper Course to the Lower Course
* Depth: Deeper
* Width: Wider, gentle valley
* Processes: Erosion, Transportation, Deposition
* Features: Meanders
 
**Lower Course**:
* From the Middle Course to the mouth
* Depth: Deep
* Width: Wide, flat
* Processes: Transportation, Deposition
* Features: Floodplains

###Â Profiles
**Cross Profile**:
* A cross-section of the river, showing the shape of the valley, bed, and channel itself

**Long Profile**:
* A diagram of the elevation of the river, showing the height of the river and surrounding land
