* Watershed - A line separating two drainage basins
* Tributary - A smaller river that joins a larger river
* Confluence - Where two rivers join
* Source - Where a river begins
* Mouth - Where a river flows into the sea or a lake
* Discharge - The amount of water flowing through a river, measured in cumecs (m^3/s)
* Width - How wide the river channel is
* Depth - How deep the river channel is
* Velocity - Speed of flow
* Thalweg - Fastest current
* Load - Amount of material carried by a river
