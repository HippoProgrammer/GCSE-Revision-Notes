# Physics (Y10) - Static Electricity
## Electric Charges and Fields
### Electric Charge
Electric charge can be either positive or negative.

For example, electrons are negative, while protons are positive.

Like charges repell, unlike charges attract.

### Electric Fields Around Charges
Field lines represent the force on a positive charge at that location.

Positive charges have field lines with arrows facing outwards.
Negative charges have field lines with arrows facing inwards.
More field lines (and arrows) represent a charge with greater strength.

## Charging Objects with Static Electricity
### Charging by Friction
When substances on the opposite sides of the **electronegativity scale** are rubbed together, electrons are transferred from one of the substances to the other.

The material that gains electrons becomes negatively charged.
The material that loses electrons becomes positively charged.
The two materials have charges of equal strength but opposite polarity.

### Charging by Induction
When a negatively charged substance is brought near a neutral substance, the electrons in the neutral substance are repelled by the negatively charged object, leaving the side nearest said object positively charged, so attraction between the objects occurs.
When a positively charged substance is brooght near a neutral substance, the electrons in the neutral substance are attracted by the positively charged object, leaving the side nearest said object negatively charged, so attraction between the objects occurs.

## Effects of Static Electricity
### Sparking
Sparking occurs when enough charge builds up, and the objects are close but not touching.
This is because there is a potential difference between the objects - causing the transfer of negative electrons, balancing the charge between the objects.

## Dangers and Uses of Static Electricity
### Uses of Static Electricity
* Used in photocopiers to stick toner powder to paper, to produce an image
* Used to attract paint to only the correct area, when painting cars etc.
* Used to remove airborne particles, in air filters etc.

### Dangers of Static Electricity
* Can set fire to flammable fuel, especially during aircraft refuelling
* Can damage sensitive electronics or computer hardware
* Can cause lightning strikes when static builds up between clouds and the ground
