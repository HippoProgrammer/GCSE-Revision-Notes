# Physics (Y10) - Electricity

## Current
### Definition and Equation
Current is defined as 'the rate of flow of electrical charge', and is measured in amps using an ammeter.

Electric current flows from the positive terminal (anode) of a power supply to the negative terminal (cathode).

Current is a measure of charge per second, as defined by this equation:

`Q = It`
Charge (Q) = Current (I) * Time (t)
(Coulombs, C) (Amps, A) (seconds, s)

### Series + Parallel
**Series**: 
* Current is the same everywhere in the circuit
* More resistance reduces current

**Parallel**:
* Total current into a branch = Total current out of the branch
* More branches increases total current through the cell

## Potential Difference (Voltage)
### Definition and Equation
p.d. (or voltage) is defined as 'the energy transferred to the circuit per unit of charge', and is measured in volts using a voltmeter.

p.d. is a measure of energy per unit of charge, as defined by this equation:

`V = E/Q`
Voltage (V) = Energy (E) / Charge (Q)
(Volts, V) (Joules, J) (Coulombs, C)

### Series + Parallel
**Series**:
* Total voltage through the cell is divded by each source of resistance
* Voltage is shared - Total voltage = V1 + V2 + V3 ....

**Parallel**:
* Voltage is the same everywhere in the circuit - Total voltage = V1 = V2 = V3
