# Physics (Y10) - Electricity

## Current
### Definition and Equation
Current is defined as 'the rate of flow of electrical charge', and is measured in amps using an ammeter.

Electric current flows from the positive terminal (anode) of a power supply to the negative terminal (cathode).

Current is a measure of charge per second, as defined by this equation:

`Q = It`

Charge (Q) = Current (I) * Time (t)

(Coulombs, C) (Amps, A) (seconds, s)

### Series + Parallel
**Series**: 
* Current is the same everywhere in the circuit
* More resistance reduces current

**Parallel**:
* Total current into a branch = Total current out of the branch
* More branches increases total current through the cell

## Potential Difference (Voltage)
### Definition and Equation
p.d. (or voltage) is defined as 'the energy transferred to the circuit per unit of charge', and is measured in volts using a voltmeter.

p.d. is a measure of energy per unit of charge, as defined by this equation:

`V = E/Q`

Voltage (V) = Energy (E) / Charge (Q)

(Volts, V) (Joules, J) (Coulombs, C)

### Series + Parallel
**Series**:
* Total voltage through the cell is divided by each source of resistance
* Voltage is shared in ratio of resistance - Total voltage = V1 + V2 + V3 ....

**Parallel**:
* Voltage is the same everywhere in each branch in the circuit - Total voltage = V1 = V2 = V3
* However, within each branch, voltage is shared in ratio of resistance - Branch voltage = V1 + V2 + V3

## Resistance
### Definition and Equation
Resistance is defined as 'the opposition a component has to the flow of current', and is measured in Ohms using an ohmmeter.

Resistance is a measure of p.d. per unit of current, as defined by this equation:

`V = IR`

Voltage (V) = Current (I) * Resistance (R)

(Volts, V) (Amps, A) (Ohms, omega)

### Series + Parallel
**Series**:
* Resistors in series add: e.g. 10 Ohms + 10 Ohms = 20 Ohms

**Parallel**:
* Resistors in parallel reduce the total resistance: 1/Rt = 1/R1 + 1/R2, therefore the total resistance is always less than the resistance of the lowest resistor.

## IV (Current - Voltage) Graphs
You can plot graphs to show the relationship between voltage and current. However, as these graphs are based on `V = IR`, the gradient of the graph is determined by the resistance of the component, and as such these graphs can be used to calculate resistance.

### Resistor IV Graph
* Straight Line
* Resistors are not very temperature-sensitive, so follow Ohm's Law (`V = IR`) almost perfectly, maintaining a constant resistance.

### Filament Lamp IV Graph
* 'S-shaped' Line
* Filament lamps are more temperature-sensitive. As current increases, so does the bulb temperature. This causes the atoms to vibrate more, causing more frequent collisions between them and the electrons, increasing the resistance.

### Diode IV Graph
* Exponentially Increasing Line
* Diodes are semiconductors. This means that they only begin conducting at a specific voltage, after which they have very low resistance (when current flows from the diode's + to -, forward bias) and very high resistance (when current flows from the diode's - to +, reverse bias).

### Wire IV Graph
* Straight Line
* Like resistors, wires follow Ohm's Law almost perfectly.
